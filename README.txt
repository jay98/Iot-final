Each folder contains respective README files on how to how to run different
aspects of the code. This README just has links to webpages that help you
get the cloud enviornment setup to get it running

Step 1: Register the device with the IBM watson Iot Platform using the following link:
https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/devices/libraries/python.html#python

You'll see in the link that each applicaion and devide needs a .cfg file to connect to ibm
iot. We have deleted these files in the code submission for security reasons

Step 2: Deploying the app on google cloud engine
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/

Step 3: Storing data is firebase
https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase
I have deleted the config data here for security reasosn

Step 4: Register device to the google assitant api
https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/setup

This also requires a client_secret file which I have deleted again for security reasons
